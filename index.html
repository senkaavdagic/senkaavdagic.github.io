  Every GitHub account is entitled to a single user/organization site, located in a repository called <username>.github.io and accessible at https://<username>.github.io (unless a custom domain is configured). User/organization sites are automatically published from the master branch, and cannot be published from any other source.

Project sites, on the other hand, can be enabled on any repository, and are accessible at https://<username>.github.io/repository-name (again, unless a custom domain is configured). These sites can be published from the master branch, gh-pages branch, or the /docs folder on the master branch, but must be explicitly enabled by configuring a publishing source under your repository’s settings tab.

Solution: Verify the publishing source and published URL from your repository’s settings tab
Double check that you are using the correct URL by visiting your repository’s Settings, and scrolling down to the GitHub Pages section. You should see the URL where your site is published. Here, you can also verify that a publishing source is set, and that it matches your expectations.Every GitHub account is entitled to a single user/organization site, located in a repository called <username>.github.io and accessible at https://<username>.github.io (unless a custom domain is configured).
